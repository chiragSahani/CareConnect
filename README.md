## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is built with a modern, scalable, and maintainable frontend architecture.

| Layer          | Technology                               | Rationale                                           |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **UI Framework** | React 18 + TypeScript                    | For building robust, type-safe, component-based UIs. |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS                             | A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. |
| **Routing** | React Router v6                          | For declarative client-side routing.                |
| **State** | React Context API + Hooks                | For lightweight, centralized state management.        |
| **Forms** | React Hook Form + Yup                    | For performant, flexible, and scalable form validation. |
| **Animations** | Framer Motion                            | For creating beautiful and fluid user interactions.     |
| **Icons** | Lucide React                             | A simple and beautiful icon library.                |
| **Dates** | `date-fns`                               | For modern, reliable date/time manipulation.      |
| **Build Tool** | Vite                                     | For a blazing fast development and build experience.    |
| **Charts** | `Chart.js` / `Recharts`                  | For powerful and interactive data visualizations.     |

### Architectural Overview

The application follows a component-based architecture where UI is separated into pages, layouts, and reusable components. Global state is managed via React Context to avoid prop-drilling.

## 🤖 AI-Powered Features (Powered by Gemini)

CareConnect is designed to integrate a powerful AI assistant to enhance the user experience.

**Status:** 🚧 **Planned**

### Planned Features:

  - **AI Chat Assistant:** Get 24/7 help with general health queries, platform navigation, and booking assistance.
  - **Smart Summaries:** AI-generated summaries of doctor reviews and patient feedback.
  - **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggestions for doctors based on user needs and historical data.

### Planned Authentication Flow for AI Features

To ensure security and privacy, the integration with the Gemini API will be handled securely. The flow is designed to **never expose sensitive API keys on the client-side.**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant CareConnectApp as Frontend (React)
    participant CareConnectServer as Backend (Node.js/Express - Planned)
    participant GoogleAuth as Google Auth
    participant GeminiAPI as Google AI (Gemini)

    User->>CareConnectApp: Clicks "Sign in with Google"
    CareConnectApp->>GoogleAuth: Initiates OAuth 2.0 flow
    GoogleAuth-->>User: Shows Google consent screen
    User-->>GoogleAuth: Grants permission
    GoogleAuth-->>CareConnectApp: Returns auth token (JWT)

    User->>CareConnectApp: Interacts with AI Chatbot
    CareConnectApp->>CareConnectServer: Sends chat query with user's JWT
    CareConnectServer->>CareConnectServer: Verifies JWT to authenticate user
    CareConnectServer->>GeminiAPI: Makes secure API call with its own secret API key
    GeminiAPI-->>CareConnectServer: Returns AI-generated response
    CareConnectServer-->>CareConnectApp: Forwards the response
    CareConnectApp-->>User: Displays AI response in chat
```

### Implementation Status

  - [x] UI designed for AI Chat and Google Sign-In.
  - [ ] Backend endpoint for secure API calls to Gemini.
  - [ ] User authentication (e.g., JWT-based) to protect endpoints.
  - [ ] Real-time communication with WebSocket for the chat interface.

-----

## 📈 Future Enhancements

  - [ ] **Backend & Database:** Transition from mock data to a full-fledged backend (e.g., Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL/MongoDB) for managing users, doctors, and appointments.
  - [ ] **User Authentication:** Implement secure login/registration for patients and doctors.
  - [ ] **Real-Time Notifications:** Add email or SMS notifications for appointment reminders.
  - [ ] **Telemedicine:** Integrate video conferencing for virtual consultations.
  - [ ] **Admin Dashboard:** A dedicated dashboard for healthcare providers to manage their profiles and schedules.
  - [ ] **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
  - [ ] **PWA Conversion:** Enhance the app to be a Progressive Web App for offline capabilities.
